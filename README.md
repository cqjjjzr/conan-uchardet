## License Information

CharlieJiang's packages are hosted on [Bintray](https://bintray.com) and contain Open-Source software which is licensed by the software's maintainers and NOT me.  For each Open-Source package published by me, the packaging process obtains the required license files along with the original source files from the maintainer, and includes these license files in the generated Conan packages.

The contents of this GIT repository are completely separate from the software being packaged and therefore licensed separately.  The license for all files contained in this GIT repository are defined in the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file in this repository.  The licenses included with all Conan packages published by me can be found in the Conan package directories in the following locations, relative to the Conan Cache root (`~/.conan` by default):

### License(s) for packaged software:

    ~/.conan/data/<pkg_name>/<pkg_version>/charliejiang/package/<random_package_id>/license/<LICENSE_FILES_HERE>

*Note :   The most common filenames for OSS licenses are `LICENSE` AND `COPYING` without file extensions.*

### License for my recipe:

    ~/.conan/data/<pkg_name>/<pkg_version>/charliejiang/export/LICENSE.md
